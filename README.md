It used to deliver to kindle devices, but right now it's not working. it's in the to-do list and will be fixed soon. you can still deliver to mail addresses.

You can call the program by
	
	perl eksi.pl

to send to all recipients, or

	perl eksi.pl d

to activate dev mode, that is, you can send to another set of recipients for testing purposes.
